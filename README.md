# Project Zap
Project Zap is a “shift sharing” application which enables furloughed workers to book shifts at a company which has demand for labor. Project Zap can also be customized and integrated with a company’s existing time and attendance tools to allow workers to book shifts across jobs within the company. 

Companies can easily upload available shifts at their locations from a CSV file or post those shifts directly from the Project Zap application interface. Those shifts can be made available to a partnering company with a supply of labor (due to furlough or flexible scheduling) via a specific partner code. That code is required for workers to enter the Project Zap portal to view and book shifts made available by the company with demand.

The source code has been made available on GitHub to quickly enable companies to provide access to work opportunities and meet the labor needs of essential businesses.
